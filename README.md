## Background
Just because a stepper motor and board were part of a experimental-kit that I had bought 2 years ago, I decided to give it try.
I was turned out to be a fun exercise.

Many others have done that already, but for me it was understand the basics of half-step, full-step and accuracy.
 
## Software installation

The software is included in appendix of the document and as .ino. It can be copied and paste into an Arduino IDE.
It has been tested with IDE version 1.8.6
